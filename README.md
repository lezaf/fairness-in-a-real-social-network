# Fairness in a real social network
This is a project for measuring fairness in ranking algorithms results. It was developed for the course "D6 - Online Social Networks and Media" of my MSc degree under the supervision of [E. Pitoura](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/~pitoura/) and [P. Tsaparas](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/~tsap/). A full description of the process followed and results can be found in [REPORT.pdf](/REPORT.pdf) file. 

## Notes
